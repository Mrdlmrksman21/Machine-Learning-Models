Various Machine Learning Models
ðŸš€ Smart City Multi-Task ML Suite
A flexible machine learning pipeline built to analyze smart city citizen activity data and predict multiple urban metricsâ€”such as transport mode, carbon footprint, and energy consumptionâ€”using classification, regression, or clustering models.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:

Multi-output support: predict multiple target columns in one run

User-selectable models: classification, regression, clustering

Handles categorical & numeric data with automatic preprocessing

Models used: RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor, KMeans

Built for real-world smart city analytics, behavior forecasting, and sustainability insights

ðŸ”§ Easily extendable, interpretable, and portfolio-ready for ML and data science roles in AI, urban tech, and smart systems.
